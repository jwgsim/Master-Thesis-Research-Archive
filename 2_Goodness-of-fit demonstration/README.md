### Goodness-of-fit demonstration subrepository
This subrepository contains the necessary files for executing the goodness-of-fit demonstration. More specifically, this subrepository contains: 

* `Data`: A folder containing two data files: `cov19.dat` and `not19.net`. These two files contain information on a single classroom from a sample of classrooms obtained by [Vermeij (2007)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0268580907082248). More specifically, `cov19.dat` contains co-variate information on the students in the classroom where `not19.net` contains friendship nominations between the students. Note that permission has been obtained for using these data in a private repository. The reader is requested not to further re-distribute these files without express permission. 
* `Goodness-of-fit demonstration.R`: An annotated R-script for obtaining the goodness-of-fit of an exponential random graph model which has been applied to the Vermeij classroom data. Annotations which discuss how to extend goodness-of-fit from the level of the network to the level of the sample are also provided.  

Please note that the reader should specify the working directory on line 28 of the `Goodness-of-fit demonstration.R`-script to a local folder containing the `cov19.dat` and `not19.net` data files.
