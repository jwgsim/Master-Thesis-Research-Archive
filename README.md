### Research Archive Master Thesis JWG Simons
This repository contains the necessary files for replicating the master thesis manuscript "On the validity of applying the exponential random graph model to a network sample"" by Jan-Willem Simons. 

Note that at the time of writing (22-01-2021) the results and conclusion sections have not yet been implemented in the master thesis manuscript. To provide the reader with a sense of some of the methods that are described in the manuscript, the `2_Goodness-of-fit demonstration` folder has been included in the research archive. This folder contains an R-script which demonstrates to the reader how to obtain the goodness-of-fit of an exponential random graph model on the level of the individual network. The script additionally discusses how the method can be extended to obtain goodness-of-fit on the level of the network sample. Note that this is not a comprehensive overview of all methods discussed in the manuscript. Also please note that the files in the `1_Manuscript` are sufficient for obtaining the master thesis manuscript in its most recent state.
