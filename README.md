### Research Archive Master Thesis JWG Simons
This repository contains the necessary files for replicating the master thesis manuscript "On the validity of applying the exponential random graph model to a network sample"" by Jan-Willem Simons. Note that at the time of writing (22-01-2021) the results and conclusion sections have not yet been implemented. Nevertheless, to provide a reader with a sense of the metholodcal implementation sense. To that end, the `2_Goodness-of-fit demonstration` folder has been included which contains an R-script which shows how to obtain goodness-of-fit (GOF) on the level of the individual network. Within the R-script it is additionally discussed how the implemented framework can be extended to obtain GOF on the level of the social network sample. Note therefore that the files in the `1_Manuscript` are sufficient for obtaining the thesis manuscript in its most recent state.
