### Research Archive Master Thesis JWG Simons
This repository contains the necessary files for replicating the master thesis manuscript "On the validity of applying the exponential random graph model to a network sample"" by Jan-Willem Simons. 

Note that at the time of writing (22-01-2021) the results and conclusion sections are not yet implemented in the thesis manuscript. To provide the reader with a sense of the methodological implementation of what is presented in the manuscript, the `2_Goodness-of-fit demonstration` folder has been included in the research archive. This folder contains an R-script which shows the reader how to obtain goodness-of-fit (GOF) on the level of the individual network. It additionally discusses how the implemented framework can be extended to obtain GOF on the level of the social network sample. Please note however that the files in the `1_Manuscript` are sufficient for obtaining the thesis manuscript in its most recent state.
