### Addendum B. Privacy.

Data protection impact assessment: This study makes use of personal data to conduct a simulation study. Within reason, 
it is impossible to directly trace this information to the concerned individual. As such, no privacy issues are 
identified.

The empirical data files cannot be traced directly to the individual concerned. All raw data files that are stored are 
de-identified. 

Informed consent was not a relevant factor during the data collection. 

The research archive package is to be stored on the secured O-drive of the University of Utrecht faculty server.
