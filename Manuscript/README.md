### Thesis Manuscript Subrepository
This subrepository contains the necessary files for reproducing the thesis manuscript in Portable Document Format (PDF). More specifically, this subrepository contains: 

* `manuscript.tex`: A LaTeX file for preparing a PDF of the thesis manuscript. 
* `name.bib`: A BibTeX bibliography file for formatting the reference list.   
* `manuscript.pdf`: A PDF reference file of the thesis manuscript. 
* A set of remaining auxiliary files.

The `manuscript.pdf` PDF reference file can be reproduced by compiling the `manuscript.tex` LaTeX and `name.bib` BibTeX bibliography files in a LaTeX editor, such as [`TeXmaker`](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) or [`Overleaf`](http://overleaf.com).
