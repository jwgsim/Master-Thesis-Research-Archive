### Thesis Manuscript Subrepository
This subrepository contains the files that are required for reproducing the thesis manuscript in Portable Document Format (PDF). More specifically, this subrepository contains: 

* `manuscript.tex`: A $\LaTeX$ file for preparing a PDF of the thesis manuscript. 
* `name.bib`: A ${Bib}\TeX$ bibliography file for formatting the reference list.   
* `manuscript.pdf`: A PDF reference file of the thesis manuscript. 
* A set of auxiliary files.

The `manuscript.pdf` PDF reference file can be reproduced by compiling the `manuscript.tex` $\LaTeX$ and `name.bib` ${Bib}\TeX$ bibliography files in a $\LaTeX$ editor, such as [`TeXmaker`](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) or [`Overleaf`](http://overleaf.com).
